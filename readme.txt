Shape Calculator Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the area and perimeter of squares, rectangles, and circles based on user input.

Program Overview:

- Presents a menu to the user to select a shape
- Uses a switch statement to handle the user's choice
- Prompts the user to input the necessary dimensions (length, width, radius)
- Calculates and displays the area and perimeter of the selected shape

Features:

- User input for shape selection and dimensions
- Switch statement for handling multiple shape options
- Calculations for area and perimeter of squares, rectangles, and circles
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./shape_calculator
    - On Windows: shape_calculator.exe
4. Select a shape and enter the necessary dimensions when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using switch statements for multiple choice selection
- Working with floating-point variables and arithmetic operators
- Basic geometry calculations for area and perimeter
